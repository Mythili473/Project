Human Pose Estimation and Object Pattern Detection
This project implements Human Pose Estimation and Object Pattern Detection using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques. Human Pose Estimation detects key points of the human body to analyze movements, while Object Pattern Detection identifies and recognizes specific patterns in images or videos. Both tasks are accomplished using deep learning models.

Features
Human Pose Estimation:
Detects key body joints (like head, shoulders, elbows, knees, etc.) in real-time.
Works on images and video streams.
Provides a skeleton overlay to visualize the pose.

Object Pattern Detection:
Identifies specific object patterns (like logos, textures, or repetitive structures).
Supports multi-object detection.
Works on both still images and videos.

Tech Stack
   Language: Python 3
Libraries:
   OpenCV: For image and video processing.
   MediaPipe: For human pose estimation.
   YOLO or Mask R-CNN: For object pattern detection.
   Matplotlib: For plotting key points and bounding boxes.
